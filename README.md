This  project  enables  disabled  individuals  to  control appliances  via  gestures  using  a  wall-mounted  camera  and trained  LSTM  model.  The  model  predicts  gestures, transmitting  commands  to  an  Arduino  Uno,  which  controls
appliances  using  a  relay .  A  video  dataset  of  100  diverse hand  gestures  was  collected  to  develop  the  system, showcasing  a  wide  range  of  movements  for  appliance control, as detailed in Table 1.1.

AIM AND OBJECTIVES:

This  project  aims  to  use  hand  gestures  to  control home  appliances  and  devices  for  elderly  and disabled people using computer vision technology.
The main objectives of this system are:
1. To  collect  a  comprehensive  dataset  of  hand gestures from a variety of individuals.
2. Train  a  deep  learning  model  using  the  collected dataset  to accurately  interpret and recognize hand gestures as distinct commands for device control.
3. To conduct real-time testing.
4. Integrating with Home Appliances
